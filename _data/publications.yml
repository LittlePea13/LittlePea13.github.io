    Computational modelling of political discourse tasks has become an increasingly important area of research in natural language 
    processing. Populist rhetoric has risen across the political sphere in recent years; however, computational approaches to it have 
    been scarce due to its complex nature. In this paper, we present the new Us vs. Them dataset, consisting of 6861 Reddit comments 
    annotated for populist attitudes and the first large-scale computational models of this phenomenon. We investigate the relationship 
    between populist mindsets and social groups, as well as a range of emotions typically associated with these. We set a baseline for 
    two tasks related to populist attitudes and present a set of multi-task learning models that leverage and demonstrate the importance 
    of emotion and group identification as auxiliary tasks.

    There has been an increased interest in modelling political discourse within the natural language processing (NLP) community, 
    in tasks such as political bias and misinformation detection, among others. Metaphor-rich and emotion-eliciting communication 
    strategies are ubiquitous in political rhetoric, according to social science research. Yet, none of the existing computational 
    models of political discourse has incorporated these phenomena. In this paper, we present the first joint models of metaphor, 
    emotion and political rhetoric, and demonstrate that they advance performance in three tasks: predicting political perspective 
    of news articles, party affiliation of politicians and framing of policy issues.
